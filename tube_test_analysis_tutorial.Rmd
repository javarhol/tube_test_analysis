## Background

The tube test is a commonly used behavioral assay to help determine the dominance ranks of mice or rats kept in the laboratory. Briefly, a narrow tube is placed horizontally on a table and cage-mates are placed at opposite ends of the tube. The cage-mates will meet in the middle and the animal that pushes the other out is considered the "winner" of that trial. All cage-mates compete with one another multiple times in a round-robin tournament to determine who is alpha, beta, gamma, epsilon, etc. More details on the protocol can be found from the [Nature Methods paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-018-0116-4), and I published an [overview and critique](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352464789_Competitive_Exclusion) in 2019.

Below is the general pipeline/method I used to determine the dominance ranks of animals using the tube-test. I used this method in the following publications: <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-24624-4> and <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-49612-0>

You can download this R Markdown file and run the same code with your own data.\

## Summary of data analytics used

This work uses the R packages, dplyr and tidyr to organize the data into a usable form. The data is then run with the 'compete' package to determine the dominance ranks. Custom graphs were made with ggplot to visualize the changes in dominance rank across three weeks. The data is then filtered and analyzed per behavioral test (exploration, zero-maze, stress hormones, and body mass) with complementary plots.

## Determining the dominance ranks with the 'compete' package

### Packages

First, we will load the packages into R.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(compete) #devtools::install_github('jalapic/compete') 
```

### Import data and clean

Let's first import the data and look at the structure

```{r}
#import data
tube_test_outcomes <- read.csv("data/tube_test_outcomes.csv", nrows=546)
head(tube_test_outcomes)
```

The most important columns are the cage_id, opponent_1, opponent_2 and the trails; t1, t2, t3, t4. The opponent columns refer to the individual animal_id, who is competing within whom (e.g., animal 1 vs. animal 5). The trial columns refer to which animal won the interaction, 1 refers to opponent_1 and 2 refers to opponent_2. The other columns (e.g., batch, test_day, experimenter) are less important, but can be used to test for differences in ranks between experimenters, batches, days, etc.

We now need to restructure the data for analysis.

1.  First, I would like to concatenate test_day and cage_id so I can calculate a different dominance rank per test_day.

2.  Second, I would like the opponents to have clear animal_ids, so I need to concatenate cage_id and opponent_x.

3.  Third, I would like a long data set where the outcomes of all trials are in the same column.

```{r}
#1.concatenate cage_id and test_day
tube_test_outcomes <- tube_test_outcomes %>%
  select(test_day,cage_id, opponent_1, opponent_2, t1, t2, t3, t4) %>%
  within(cage_day <- paste(cage_id, test_day, sep = "-d")) %>%
  select(opponent_1, opponent_2, t1, t2, t3, t4, cage_day, cage_id)
#2.rename opponent data to animal_id
tube_test_outcomes$opponent_1 <- paste(tube_test_outcomes$cage_id, tube_test_outcomes$opponent_1, sep="-")
tube_test_outcomes$opponent_2 <- paste(tube_test_outcomes$cage_id, tube_test_outcomes$opponent_2, sep="-")
#3.make a long dataset
long_data <- data.frame(tube_test_outcomes[1:2], tube_test_outcomes[7:8], stack(tube_test_outcomes[3:6]))
long_data <- long_data[,c("opponent_1", "opponent_2", "values", "ind", "cage_day", "cage_id")]
head(long_data)
```

### Convert data tables into lists

Now the data is in a long format where values refer to the outcome of the tube test trial and ind refers to the corresponding trial.

To determine the dominance ranks for each cage_id or cage_day, we need to divide the data into a list. Then we can apply a function to the list using lapply and append the results to a single data frame using rbind.

```{r}
#split up long_data by day_id
day_list <- split(long_data, as.factor(long_data$cage_day))

#splitup long_dat by Cage (compound all 3 trials)
cage_list <- split(long_data, as.factor(long_data$cage_id))
```

### David's Score

Now, we can calculate the David's score using the lists and lapply with rbind.

```{r}
#make a custom function that formats the table into a win-loss matrix and then runs the ds function.
get_ds <- function(x){
  matrix <- get_wl_matrix(x, ties="keep")
  david_scores <- as.data.frame(ds(matrix, norm=FALSE, type = "D"))
}

#get david scores for each item in the list
ds_per_week <- do.call(rbind, lapply(day_list, get_ds))

#tidy data
ds_per_week <- ds_per_week %>% 
  rename(ds = `ds(matrix, norm = FALSE, type = "D")`) %>% 
  mutate(cage_day = rownames(.)) %>% 
  separate_wider_delim(cage_day, delim = ".", names = c("cage_day", "animal_id")) %>% 
  separate_wider_delim(cage_day, delim = "-", names = c("cage_id", "day")) %>% 
  select(cage_id, animal_id, day, ds)

write.csv(ds_per_week, "data/ds_per_week.csv")

head(ds_per_week)
```

We can use this same method for the cage_list

```{r}
#get david scores for each item in the list
ds_per_cage <- do.call(rbind, lapply(cage_list, get_ds))

#tidy data
ds_per_cage <- ds_per_cage %>% 
  rename(ds = `ds(matrix, norm = FALSE, type = "D")`) %>% 
  mutate(cage_animal_id = rownames(.)) %>% 
  separate_wider_delim(cage_animal_id, delim = ".", names = c("cage_id", "animal_id")) %>% 
  select(cage_id, animal_id, ds)

write.csv(ds_per_week, "data/ds_per_cage.csv")

head(ds_per_cage)
```

### Dominance Rank

The same method can be used to determine the dominance rank, and any other metric

```{r}
get_MinRank <- function(x){
  matrix <- get_wl_matrix(x, ties="keep")
  wins <- rowSums(matrix)
  total_wins <- as.data.frame(wins)
  total_wins$ID <- rownames(total_wins)
  total_wins <- mutate(total_wins, rank = rank(-wins, ties.method="min"))
  total_wins <- select(total_wins, ID, wins, rank)
  return(total_wins)
}

#ranks per week
ranks_per_week <- do.call(rbind, lapply(day_list, get_MinRank))
#tidy
ranks_per_week <- ranks_per_week %>% 
  mutate(cage_day = rownames(.)) %>% 
  separate_wider_delim(cage_day, delim = ".", names = c("cage_day", "animal_id")) %>% 
  separate_wider_delim(cage_day, delim = "-", names = c("cage_id", "day")) %>% 
  select(cage_id, animal_id, day, wins, rank)
write.csv(ranks_per_week, "data/ranks_per_week.csv")

#ranks per cage
ranks_per_cage <- do.call(rbind, lapply(cage_list, get_MinRank))
#tidy
ranks_per_cage <- ranks_per_cage %>% 
  mutate(tempid = rownames(.)) %>% 
  separate_wider_delim(tempid, delim = ".", names = c("cage_id", "animal_id")) %>% 
  select(cage_id, animal_id, wins, rank)
write.csv(ranks_per_cage, "data/ranks_per_cage.csv")
```

### Landau's h

Then use the same general method to calculate the Landau's score (the linearity of the dominance hierarchy)

```{r}
Landau <- function(x){
  matrix <- get_wl_matrix(x, ties="remove")
  devries(matrix)
}

#each day
landau_per_week <- do.call(rbind, lapply(day_list, Landau))
landau_per_week <- as.data.frame(landau_per_week) %>% 
  mutate(tempid = rownames(.)) %>% 
  separate_wider_delim(tempid, delim = "-", names = c("cage_id", "day"))
landau_per_week$`h-modified` <- as.numeric(landau_per_week$`h-modified`)
landau_per_week$`p-value` <- as.numeric(landau_per_week$`p-value`)
write.csv(as.data.frame(landau_per_week), "data/landau_per_week.csv")
#each cage
landau_per_cage <- do.call(rbind, lapply(cage_list, Landau))
landau_per_cage <- as.data.frame(landau_per_cage) %>% 
  mutate(cage_id = rownames(.))
landau_per_cage$`h-modified` <- as.numeric(landau_per_cage$`h-modified`)
landau_per_cage$`p-value` <- as.numeric(landau_per_cage$`p-value`)
write.csv(landau_per_cage, "data/landau_per_cage.csv")
```

### Stability

We can also restructure the data to determine whether individual animals were stable or unstable across test_days

```{r}
#add animal_id to ranks_per_week
animal_inventory <- read.csv("data/animal_inventory.csv")
sex_id <- select(animal_inventory, animal_id, sex)
ranks_per_week <- left_join(ranks_per_week, sex_id, by = "animal_id")
#add the cage_rank to ranks_per_week
cage_rank <- ranks_per_cage %>% 
  select(animal_id, rank) %>% 
  rename(cage_rank = rank)
ranks_per_week <- left_join(ranks_per_week, cage_rank, by = "animal_id")

stability <- ranks_per_week %>% 
  select(cage_id, animal_id, sex, cage_rank, day, rank) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = day, values_from = rank) %>% 
  mutate(stability = case_when(
    d1 == d2 & d2 == d3 ~ "stable",
    d1 != d2 ~ "unstable",
    d1 != d3 ~ "unstable",
    d2 != d3 ~ "unstable"
  )) %>% 
  filter(stability == "stable")

write.csv(stability, "data/stability.csv")

head(stability)

```
